I've made a few security changes based on best practices recommended in
* "The OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications":http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project
* "Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO":http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/web-authentication.html

They're described in more detail below.

h2. Changes to session_controller

* use uniform logout function
* avoid calling logged_in? which will auto-log-you-in (safe in the face of
  logout! call, but idiot-proof
* log in is where reset_session is really needed -- wherever it goes, it has to
  be in front of the current_user= call
* using uniform remember_cookie functions
* made a place to take action on failed login attempt
* recycle login and remember_me setting on failed login
* nil'ed out the password field in 'new' view

h3. Changes to users_controller

* made the implicit login only happen for non-activationed sites
* made logout / session_reset'ing uniform across controllers
* On a failed signup, kick you back to the signin screen (but strip out the password & confirmation)
* use uniform logout function
* more descriptive error messages in activate()
* don't auto-login on activate.  If the plugin is going to, there needs to be a
  single point of entry among session/new, users/new and users/activate.

h3. users_helper

* link_to_user, link_to_current_user, link_to_signin_with_IP convenience
  functions
* if_authorized(action, resource, &block) view function (with appropriate
  warning)

h3. authenticated_system

* Made authorized? take optional arguments action=nil, resource=nil, *args
  This makes its signature better match traditional approaches to access control
  eg Reference Monitor in \"Security Patterns\":http://www.securitypatterns.org/patterns.html)
* authorized? should be a helper too
* added uniform logout! methods
* format.any (as found in access_denied) doesn't work until
  http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8987 lands.
* cookies, just like session tokens, should be refreshed each time we cross the
  logged out/in barrier http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management#Regeneration_of_Session_Tokens
* !!!! Possibly stupid !!!
  Made current_user and logged_in? be public methods.  I did this for the worst
  possible reason -- so that I could write story steps that call it directly.
  However, they're already globally public methods in principle through their
  exposure as helper methods.  But if there's a less kludgy fix please educate
  me.

h3. Changes to model

* recently_activated? belongs only if stateful
* Gave migration a 40-char limit on remember_token & an index on users by login

h4. Token generation

The salt and the remember_token should be generated from completely
unpredictable, irreversible input.  Using the user's email and Time.now leave
the improbable but feasible attack of watching a person (whose email you've
captured) log in with 'remember me', then replaying the hash of their email and
times +/- a few seconds.  I made salt, activation_code and remember_token calls
all use the same call, and I increased the entropy of that call.

h4. Token regeneration

The session and the remember_token should both be expired and regenerated
every time we cross the logged out / logged in barrier by either password
or cookie.  ("To reduce the risk from session hijacking":http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management#Regeneration_of_Session_Tokens
and brute force attacks, the HTTP server can seamlessly expire and
regenerate tokens. This decreases the window of opportunity for a replay or
brute force attack.)

h4. Session resetting

I moved the reset_session call in the session controller (and the
users_controller on signup) into the 'success' path -- the CSRF can't do
anything until the user logs in. Since a redirect follows, it doesn't give
request-forgery crapstains going forward, though hitting back button and
resubmiting an earlier form will.  I think it's Mostly Harmless but I've left it
commented out.  

I'd like to get the advice of someone who understands CSRF better than I on this
change.

h3. Views

* Used escapes <%= %> in email templates (among other reasons, so courtenay's
  "'dumbass' test":http://tinyurl.com/684g9t doesn't complain)

h3. Specs

* 100% coverage (needed some access_control checks, and the http_auth stuff)

h3. Stories

* added them
