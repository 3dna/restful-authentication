This is mrflip's fork of "technoweenie's restful-authentication":/technoweenie/restful-authentication/
plugin. The goal is to

* Modularize to match security design patterns:
** Authentication (currently: password, browser cookie token, HTTP basic)
** Trust metric (email validation) 
** Authorization (stateful roles)
* Add full RSpec and Story test suite
* Leave a flexible framework that will play nicely with other access control / policy definition / trust metric plugins

See the "wiki":http://github.com/mrflip/restful-authentication/wikis/home for notes on
* "Security Design Patterns":Security-Patterns
* [[Authentication]] -- Lets a visitor identify herself (and lay claim to her corresponding Roles and measure of Trust)
* "Trust Metrics":Trustification -- Confidence we can rely on the outcomes of this visitor's actions.
* "Authorization and Policy":Authorization -- Based on trust and identity, what actions may this visitor perform?
* "Access Control":Access-Control -- How the Authorization policy is actually enforced in your code (hopefully without turning it into a spaghetti of if thens)
* "Rails Security Plugins":RailsPlugins -- for Authentication, Trust, Authorization and Access Control

These best versions are in the notes/ directory in the "source code":http://github.com/mrflip/restful-authentication/tree/master -- look there for the latest version.
The wiki versions are taken (manually) from there.

Restful Authentication Generator
====

This is a basic restful authentication generator for rails, taken from
acts as authenticated.  Currently it requires Rails 1.2.6 or above.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions \
    --include-activation \
    --stateful \
    --rspec \
    --skip-migration \
    --skip-routes

The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup
(typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is
created, as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is
the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the
site.

The third parameter (--include-activation) generates the code for a
ActionMailer and its respective Activation Code through email.

The fourth (--stateful) builds in support for acts_as_state_machine and
generates activation code.  (--stateful implies --include-activation).
This was taken from:

http://www.vaporbase.com/postings/stateful_authentication

Passing --skip-migration will skip the user migration, and --skip-routes will
skip resource generation -- both useful if you've already run this generator.

Pass --rspec to generate a (more thorough) set of RSpec tests.  This
requires the RSpec and Rspec-on-rails plugins: http://rspec.info/

***************************************************************************
Post-install

The below assumes a Model named 'User' and a Controller named
'Session'; please alter to suit.

Try these for some familiar login URLs if you like:
  map.signup  '/signup', :controller => 'users',   :action => 'new'
  map.signin  '/login',  :controller => 'session', :action => 'new'
  map.signout '/logout', :controller => 'session', :action => 'destroy'

With --include-activation:

* Add a route to config/routes.rb:
    map.activate '/activate/:activation_code', :controller => 'users', :action => 'activate', :activation_code => nil)

* Add an observer to config/environment.rb:
    config.active_record.observers = :users_observer

* Add an observer to config/environment.rb
  config.active_record.observers = :user_observer # or whatever you 
                                                  # named your model

With --stateful:

* If you're using acts_as_state_machine, define your users resource like this:
    map.resources :users, :member => { :suspend   => :put,
                                       :unsuspend => :put,
                                       :purge     => :delete }

Security Alert
====

I introduced a change to the model controller that's been tripping 
folks up on Rails 2.0.  The change was added as a suggestion to help
combat session fixation attacks.  However, this resets the Form 
Authentication token used by Request Forgery Protection.  I've left
it out now, since Rails 1.2.6 and Rails 2.0 will both stop session
fixation attacks anyway.

Stories

There are now RSpec stories that allow expressive enjoyable tests for the
authentication code.

The flexible code for resource testing came out of code from Ben Mabey
